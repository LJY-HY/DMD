## Driver Monitoring Dataset (DMD)
The [Driver Monitoring Dataset](http://dmd.vicomtech.org/) is the largest visual dataset for real driving actions, with footage from synchronized multiple cameras (body, face, hands) and multiple streams (RGB, Depth, IR) recorded in two scenarios (real car, driving simulator). Different annotated labels related to distraction, fatigue and gaze-head pose can be used to train Deep Learning models for Driver Monitor Systems.

### Dataset Details
